                        <p>"Culture has constituted itself as a defense system against technics," 
                            Simondon proclaimed in his seminal book on the theory of technology <i>On
                            the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects</i> Simondon in in 1958, offering
                            a profound diagnosis of the relationship between culture and technics.      
                            While the outlined defensive stance that established culture tends to
                            uphold vis-à-vis technology has not changed much since the mid-20th
                            century, culture itself has certainly radically transformed culture
                            still functioned as a (technicised) culture industry which impoverished
                            human experience due to the unintelligence of the technology involved,
                            as pointed out by critics from Adorno to Stiegler. In contrast, in the
                            21st century, with the development of autonomous machine intelligence in
                            the form of generative artificial intelligence based on deep learning,
                            technics itself has been cultivated and has become a culture parallel to
                            the one generated by humans. On the non-established – both avant-garde
                            and mass-commercial – side of culture, the attitude towards technics has
                            been known to be more playful, accepting and experimental and remains so
                            today. However, it is also changing fundamentally, with technics itself
                            becoming culture. This poses new challenges even for non-established
                            culture (while established culture does not really let anything get in
                            the way of its archaic humanism).<br><br>
                            Technology today is no longer – if it ever really was – in an
                            instrumental relation to culture, as something that culture (as a
                            supposedly exclusively human activity) uses to varying effects, while
                            the real creativity is on the side of the human. Today, machines use
                            natural language and generate cultural content autonomously, making
                            20th-century forms of cultural critique no longer relevant for
                            understanding and critically engaging with today's culture. The problem
                            (intellectual and practical) is no longer that culture is technical, but
                            that technology has become cultural; and this in turn entirely
                            transforms the terrain of cultural critique and the theory of technology.<br><br>
                            The conference aims to address precisely this turn and its theoretical,
                            cultural, economic and other effects, and welcomes contributions from
                            sociology of culture, cultural studies, media studies, philosophy,
                            linguistics, theory (and practice) of contemporary art and design,
                            computer and information science and others. We are interested in both
                            theoretical as well as empirical and methodological contributions and
                            their intersections, i.e. how to think and research new forms of
                            technologically generated culture and how to overcome prejudice and
                            defunct notions, tied to past forms of culture and technology, in the
                            process.<br><br>
                            Some of the sub-topics of the conference (the list is neither exhaustive
                            nor exclusive) are: language and artificial intelligence; generative
                            artificial intelligence and cultural production; technology and
                            creativity; the persistence and significance of culture as a defence
                            system against technology; the economic effects of new cultural
                            technologies; the dangers and risks of (cultural) artificial
                            intelligence; new forms of cultural critique and theory; a re-evaluation
                            of classical forms of cultural critique and theory; the effects of
                            large-scale linguistic models on linguistics; new forms and new theories
                            of intelligence, regulation of generative AI and cultural policy; big
                            data analyses of culture ...<br><br>
                            The conference will consist of lectures, roundtable discussions and
                            thematic panels with 15-20-minute papers.<br><br>
                            The official languages of the conference will be Slovenian and English.
                            The conference will be free of charge, open to the public and without a
                            registration fee.<br><br>
