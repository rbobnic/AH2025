        title: "The Time is Now: Are Large Language Models Transforming or Transmuting the Philosophy of Language?",
        abstract: "Linguistic competence, our capacity to produce and understand sentences and words, was given a mythical and grandiose status of being a uniquely human capacity that requires innate or hardwired rules and shapes the very structure of our thoughts. This account, which I will call <em>The Inherited View</em> (IV) is shared among the intertwined fields such as analytic philosophy, especially philosophy of language as its main subfield, theoretical linguistics, and cognitive science. The Cartesian internalist position (CI) constitutes the core of IV. According to CI, we are the sole authorities in cognizing our inner modes of presentation through which we grow to recognize and even name objects. A more literal, radical, and seemingly testable pairing of thought with linguistic expression came with Fodor’s Language-of-Thought Hypothesis (LOTH). Any methodology that rejects LOTH or a theoretical framework that doesn’t hinge on the CI qua ontological assumption about the nature of linguistic competence is inherently flawed, since it fails to mirror IV.<br><br>The resurgence of deep learning (DL) models for natural language processing (NLP) in the last decade, as well as large language models (LLMs) currently implemented in commercial chatbots, seems to provide a perspective on the nature of linguistic competence that runs counter to LOTH and discredits CI. These models arguably vindicate empiricist ambitions of grounding cognitive processes in raw data and different learning algorithms. In my talk, I will argue that the most disruptive element that the empiricist view of the nature of linguistic competence presents is the decoupling of language from thought. Methodologically, this opposes LOTH and may position philosophy of language as somewhat transformed by LLMs, but without jeopardizing its conceptual foundations. However, if one maintains that such an element must bring about full refutation of the CI, then philosophers of language should start considering the process of transmutation of their subfield, which means the IV has to go. Finally,  I will outline two implications for the philosophy of language when it comes to the endorsement of the novel empiricist view of the nature of linguistic competence based on the performance of LLMs.",

        title: "<em>Kleinmeister</em>, Musical Algorithms, and the Instrumentality of Instruments",
        abstract: "Most histories of Western music still tell the story of artistic subjectivity – a succession of great figures who, across the centuries, mastered and transcended the available musical material. In their shadow hide the so‑called minor masters (<em>Kleinmeister</em>), whose works today serve merely as a backdrop for identifying what was then deemed “mediocrity,” even though they often occupied higher social positions than the now‑canonized composers. This paper turns its focus precisely to the <em>Kleinmeister</em> as exemplary faithful executors of the musical algorithm. In doing so, it draws in part on David Cope, one of the pioneers of AI‑driven composition, who understood composing as an essentially algorithmic process: wherever there is musical regularity, an algorithm can be identified, taught, rehearsed, and reworked. <br><br>We approach this starting perspective through three historical vignettes. First, we stop at Enlightenment <em>ready‑made</em> dances and musical dice games; then at the serialists and aleatoric composers who, in the name of desubjectivising composition, replaced the execution of existing algorithms with the solipsistic invention of their own algorithmic meta‑principles. Finally, we turn to a historical moment when the technology of notation – and the algorithms based on it – was disrupted by the sound of machines. These opened up a previously unknown domain of idiomatically machinic sound processing – a domain that was quickly domesticated and re‑humanized, precisely in the name of the old, human algorithm that presumes the strictly instrumental use of musical instruments.",

        title: "Why AI Sounds So Normal: Generative Tools and the Continuation of Deskilled Labour in Popular Music",
        abstract: "We have all learned to spot the fingerprints of generative AI: from em-dashes to LinkedIn-style diction and the washed-out yellow hues of AI-generated images. Popular music, however, tends to slip more easily under the radar. Viral experiments such as The Velvet Sundown and consumer-facing platforms like Udio and Suno rarely trigger the same reflex, as their outputs slide comfortably into familiar formulas. This presentation asks why such tools feel so natural and what their adoption reveals about labour dynamics in the industry.<br><br>Drawing on Adorno’s critique of standardization, Altenried’s account of digital Taylorism, and Hye-Kyung Lee’s work on precarious creative labour, we situate generative platforms within longer histories of commodification and routinization in popular music, from Motown’s assembly-line studios to the routinized work of session musicians. AI appears to accelerate deskilling by privileging lower-skilled labour, reducing bargaining power, and pressuring workers to accept tasks without the leverage to negotiate wages, job stability, or recognition of expertise. These dynamics produce a new class of “prompters,” mediators removed from both authorship and means of production. Rejecting nostalgia for a mythical artisanal past, the presentation argues that in many contexts, AI consolidates and intensifies capitalist logics already embedded in popular-music production while reshaping the visibility and precarity of creative labour.",

        title: "“Is the Class of Musicians Doomed to Extinction?”: Reactions to the Proliferation of Mechanical Reproduction of Music and Their Consequences in the Kingdom of SCS/Yugoslavia",
        abstract: "The recent aesthetic, legal, and moral anxiety expressed by musicians over AI-generated music is hardly unprecedented. Rather, it represents the latest chapter in a long-standing history of friction between musicians and technological innovation—disruptions that have continually reshaped how music is produced, consumed, and distributed. A particularly pivotal shift was the development of technologies for mechanical music reproduction, which, after the First World War, also spread widely in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, gradually joining or replacing several forms of live performance and threatening the material livelihood of musicians. By the late 1920s, professional musicians within the Association of Musicians of the Kingdom of SCS (later Yugoslavia) increasingly began to wonder: “Is the class of musicians doomed to extinction?” The existence of the musical profession was then seen as seriously threatened by the (over) rapid pace of technological development, leading them to often call on the authorities to implement various measures to protect traditional forms of their services. Yugoslav musicians voiced their demands, technonostalgic arguments, and broader critiques of new technologies in the bulletin Muzičar and other contemporary music periodicals. Observing these, the presenters will explore the implications of the discourse, which—beyond material interests and seemingly self-evident professional hierarchies—also rests on problematic forms of social exclusion and control over who is allowed to (re)create, how, where, and with what means—dilemmas that remain pertinent to this day.",

        title: "Does AI use concepts?",
        abstract: "We have never really known for certain what thinking is. But as long as we had an approximate idea of what kind of beings we should expect thought from, this was manageable: “Homo cogitat” is an axiom. This has now changed. Given the recent dramatic advances in neural networks and deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), there is an ongoing theoretical effort to renegotiate the division of mental capacities (sensing, perceiving, understanding, meaning, thinking, acting, etc.) between humans and machines. Predictable extremes in this debate are taken up by AI-sceptics and AI-enthusiasts. But alternative, in-between characterisations of AI have also appeared, such as Floridi’s “Agency without Intelligence”. Krašovec, on the other hand, suggests we are dealing with an altogether alternative form of intelligence—one that dispenses with the need for (human) concepts.<br><br>In this paper, I mainly attempt to organise this debate by clarifying which possibilities are logically coherent. The challenge lies in the fact that this debate intersects with an older philosophical dispute: what are concepts, and how do humans use them? Many philosophical themes related to AI—such as the shift from the symbolic to the connectionist paradigm, or numerous examples (actual or envisioned) of failures in AI alignment—strongly evoke the Wittgensteinian problem of rule-following, which in turn evokes Hegelian criticism of Kant: that concepts are peculiarly fuzzy, adaptable, dynamically constituted through their use. In fact, this philosophical topos has been historically used—most famously by Dreyfus—precisely as a foundation for (GOF)AI-scepticism: (GOF)AI is bound to be too reliant on concepts, using them too rigidly and mechanically to properly grasp the world. In that case, the shift to neural networks might be better described not as the abandonment of concepts but as the implementation of a more philosophically sophisticated conception of them. Many features of neural networks—for example, the phenomenon of “grokking” (Ananthaswamy)—suggest as much.<br><br>Yet another problem then arises: in the Hegelian-Wittgensteinian framework, the capability for concept-use is strongly logically connected with life. How is the logical decoupling of concept use from living beings—something the evidence increasingly seems to require—possible?",

        title: "General intellect: Intelligence without an author",
        abstract: "The tradition of humanism in philosophy and social science, which clings to the idea that intelligence, due to the unique characteristics of humans (whether consciousness or the distinctive biological characteristics of the human organism), can only be 'human', as well as certain anti-humanist theories, which see the emergence of a qualitatively completely different, strictly 'non-human' intelligence in the unique characteristics of new artificial intelligence technologies or the functioning of capital, often share a common assumption despite their obvious differences. They conceive of intelligence as an attribute or effect of a discrete entity, whether subjective or human, or objective or machine. Intelligence is often implicitly or explicitly conceived at both poles as an activity that is localized, on the one hand, in the human organism and, on the other, in a specific technology. By reproducing crude conceptual dichotomies that highlight substantial differences between humans and technology, anti-humanism can thus recreate the constitutive gesture of classical humanism. Through a critical examination of the concept of general intelligence in Marx and some of his contemporary successors (Virno, Pasquinelli, Dyer-Witheford, etc.) we will, in contrast to conceptions of intelligence as an attribute of a subject or object, develop, in the context of a critique of contemporary capitalism, the foundations for a relational conception of intelligence as a general structure of relations, patterns, and interactions between subjects and objects that cannot be reduced to either an attribute of humans or an attribute of a particular technology.",

        title: "What will (our) everyday technology do to us?",
        abstract: "From the perspective of the historical development of technology's potential and its discontinuities, such as the transition from tools to machines to autonomous systems, instrumental definitions that see them as neutral tools or available means for goals that we freely set for ourselves as actors in history seem increasingly illusory. If we assume that technology is no longer a means but has become an <em>end</em>, that it is no longer a matter of individual devices, one here, another there, but that it has become a world unto itself or even that it has itself become “cultural”, then in each of these cases it is worth returning again and again to perhaps the most interesting (anthropological) question in the shadows: what is happening to the human dimension within these technological changes and shifts? If we look at the flip side of human creative activity, i.e., how the <em>created</em> (technology) <em>recreates</em> us in reverse, in addition to the obvious changes in our habits, we are also dealing with a multitude of technologically conceived states that are much more difficult to perceive precisely because of the <em>internalisation</em> of technology, when the activity of the device becomes an integral part of our activity, or because of the <em>appearance</em> of modern technology, which appears to be less than it is. We will examine the little-known thesis of <em>Promethean shame</em> (Anders), which in condensed form states that the more the degree of “artificiality” and its demands increase throughout history, the more powerful technology becomes, the more it can generate, do, see, and calculate, the more limited, deficient, “<em>faulty</em>” seems human and finds it increasingly difficult to cope. We will offer some possible interpretations of how we are trying to extricate ourselves from this “unbearableness.”",

        abstract: "I follow Eric Powell’s paper “Making Fa(e)ces” from the Legacies of Antihumanism conference, and Simon Hajdini’s <em>What’s That Smell?</em> to further explore the philosophical implications of shit. I’ll begin with a look at Feuerbach’s humanism, which was defined by a turn away from spiritual alienation to sensual experience, but which also presupposed human experience as something clean. This gave materialist grounding to a form of humanism that, even while criticizing the one-sided spirituality of Christianity, had no place for shit. To bring shit into philosophy, I turn to Bataille’s notion of base materialism, which understands the material “base” not as an a priori, self-grounded notion of matter, but as a result of how a social formation distinguishes between the (spiritual) high and the (material) low. After Christianity defined God as high and the human as low, humanism redefined the human as high while relegating denigrated dimensions of social life to the realm of shit. Today, when technologies of artificial intelligence and social media are said to bring out the worst in people, awakening our base instincts and most vulgar selves, it may be time for a revived vulgar materialism capable of accounting for this shit.",

Thus, we assert the tech tree (or any of its adjacent or derivative schemas) as the most advanced and accurate cultural expression of our current grasp on technological advancement. Video game designers, uniquely positioned at the margins of arising computational and pop cultural modes of thought, were able to construct an emergent structure, capable of encoding key moments of release for sedimented knowledge, bestowing on players a deep intuition for strategic and systematic thinking of technology that is already shaping our reality.

This isn't just a contrarian stance; I aim to demonstrate how cultural capital can be generated, reproduced, and presented as an independent entity guided not by human experience, but by culture itself, thus transcending subjective interpretations.

        abstract: "With technological progress positioning computers as the ultimate ethical machines – in a sense of offering general principles for practice and not in the normative sense of the word – they engender digital spaces as pure infrastructural sandboxes, setting the rules of engagement and structures of possible practices for users within the interface layer. While the interfacial structures and their supplementing layers do have a certain influence on epistemic effects within the digital spaces, they are inherently contingent and infrastructural (for example, predictive and suggestive algorithms that merely set the rules of engagement instead of determining it wholly). Conversely, the implementation of a generally available AI user into the user layer of social media platforms (such as <em>xAI’s Grok</em>) shifts the epistemic dynamic from contingency to necessity: computers take on the function not only as ethical, but also as epistemic machines as they actively participate in the collective, combinatory and sedimentary nature of knowledge production, moving beyond their culturally ascribed status of mere utilities, tools. The regimes of knowledge that arise from this interplay between culture and technics can be thought of as synthetic epistemes with unique machinic and vectoral genealogies. In our contribution we aim to observe and analyse a technogenesis of knowledge that is becoming apparent with the emergence of synthetic epistemes in a way that does not reaffirm the rift drawn by “facile humanism” between cultural and technical but to understand culture as a fluid and evolving product of mediation (and co-creation) by technical objects between human and nature",

        title: "From Formal Rules to Probabilistic Language Processing: Large language models as the impetus for a new epistemology of language",
        abstract: "In this talk I explore the impact of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, on contemporary linguistics and the understanding of language as a cultural and technical practice. Unlike classical linguistic theories, which conceive of language primarily through syntactic and semantic structures (e.g., generative-transformational grammar, the structuralist paradigm, linguistic relativity theory), LLMs are based on statistical probability and neural representations of meaning. This means that language no longer functions (only) as a system of logical formal rules, but as a complex and dynamic practice that LLM reconstructs through large amounts of data.<br><br>However, this understanding is not limited to the practical functioning of LLMs: I attempt to show, based on recent studies, that LLMs model language in ways that are surprisingly similar to the functioning of the human brain, as they share three key computational principles with it: predicting the next word, calculating the deviation between the predicted and actual words, and using contextual embedding to understand meaning.<br><br>I argue that LLMs are not just new tools, but implicitly construct a new theory of language that is at once technical, cultural, and empirical. I focus on the consequences of this epistemological shift for contemporary theories of language and meaning, as well as on the implications for language as a cultural system, which in the age of artificial intelligence is becoming a place of confrontation—and reconciliation—between humans and machines.",

        abstract: "The paper proposes a triangulation of potential artistic approaches to working critically with, through, and on generative AI (GenAI), resulting in three coordinates: <em>AI imaginaries</em> – practices of conceiving and creating imagery through GenAI applications, as well as imaginaries about the limitations and potentials of AI in general; <em>AI deconstructions</em> – studies of the effects and affects fostered by GenAI and the relation to the technology’s cultural history, including the deconstruction of the technology itself; <em>AI exposures</em> – investigations into the technological and systemic conditions of GenAI and its implications for dispositifs of power and control.<br><br>The paper discusses the viability of this triangulation as a framework for the analysis of artistic practices engaging with GenAI, be it on the level of tools assisting in the creation of the work, or as research object the work critically engages with. The framework challenges the assumption that AI generators merely reproduce characteristics inherently present in the underlying datasets. Instead, it provokes us to investigate the question of how aesthetic practices may critically engage with GenAI. The paper is based on insights developed in a research seminar organized at the University of Copenhagen’s Department for Arts and Cultural Studies which hosted artists and researchers investigating GenAI.",

        abstract: "Talking about the disappearance of meaningful pictorial form and its seeming substitution by the white noise of data streams, the contemporary artist Hito Steyerl recently claimed that “not seeing anything intelligible is the new normal”. This talk examines the return of the discourse of the “rube,” or “innocent” viewer in the era of machine learning and computer vision from the history of visual media of approximately a century ago. Alongside Surrealist artists who created systems to perform acts of nonsensical (de-)classification and formlessness (Krauss, Bois) and to thereby resist the pressures of representational conventions, these mythical figures of “blind insight” (de Man) may help us understand the media illiteracy at stake in today’s notions of “invisuality” (Parikka), “mass images” (Cubitt) and AI “hallucinations.”",

        abstract: "This talk explores the types of questions that fall under the broadly understood heading aesthetics of AI. Seeking to define a question that could shape and sharpen this emerging field, it moves beyond what might be called a double-barrel examination of the <em>AI imaginary</em> – namely, the stylistic and ethical concerns surrounding images produced by or with generative AI on the one hand, and, on the other, the ways in which AI as an emerging technology is registered in human experience: how it is imagined, feared, or praised. While these are relevant aesthetic questions <em>about</em> AI, they are not necessarily questions belonging to the aesthetics <em>of</em> AI. Historically, aesthetics has oscillated between the philosophical investigation of the nature of sensory experience and the investigation of exceptional forms of experience (most notably, art) – or, as Deleuze puts it, between the study of possible and real experience. On this basis, the paper considers two guiding questions: <em>does AI have the capacity to transform the limits of possible (human?) experience, and does it introduce a real experience that exceeds the limits of (human?) aisthesis?</em>",

In early 2025, a new phenomenon, created by artificial intelligence, called Italian brainrot emerged on social media and in meme culture centred around nonsensical images of animals with equally nonsensical, Italian-sounding names. Countless short videos created an absurd and chaotic mythology around them, resulting in a kind of ironically manic (and manically ironic) collective online hallucination, in which the entire internet identified with enjoying an almost hypnotic nonsense. Basically, it was shitposting taken to the extreme, but for the first time, artificial intelligence played a central role. In this talk, I will show why the phenomenon of Italian brainrot was made possible precisely because the images were AI-generated, and I will attempt to outline what this may mean for the future influence of artificial intelligence on the aesthetics of the internet.",

What is the role of technology in evolution and hominization? Is a post-anthropocentric view of the world possible, desirable, or even necessary? And when (if ever) will humans cease to be human? First, I will attempt to present some thoughts on the original connection between the human and the technical. I will continue in two directions, the first narrower, the second broader. (1) If education makes us human, if education is the practice of humanisation (Snaza), then it is high time to (re)define what a human being is and what the role and position of various dehumanised (and even inhuman) Others, without losing the foundations that support humanity, which can be thought of, for example, with the help of “intertwined pedagogies” (which echo the work of Barad). (2) At the same time, it is also a matter of finding a way “out of the labyrinth of dualisms in which we have interpreted our bodies and tools” (Haraway) and thus the need for technological, ecological, and epistemic shifts.",

We are a global production company—we write the screenplay, we’re the directors, we’re the producers, we’re the main actors—the world is our stage.” In pre-World War III 21st-century human life, intelligence agencies operate as the ground of reality = culture, just as in Stevan Harnad’s “symbol grounding problem”, the central nervous system grounds language—without neural and glial cellular technology, language/culture loses its informational dimension, becoming just another physical property of the universe. Every grounding operation is an instance of “non-causal metaphysical determination” (cf. Kit Fine), describing how a phenomenon X exists in virtue of a phenomenon Y, whereas shifts in ground reveal a history of grounds as discrete state transitions from one ground/state to another (from central nervous system-ground to Mossad-ground). Technology is the implementation of the grounding operation itself, both in an exoteric and esoteric sense—just as Clarke/Kubrick’s Monolith (esoteric technology) creates a reality-culture through the exoteric technology of bone as a primordial homicide weapon. Like a journey to the moon of another world, each discrete state/ground transition discloses an aspect of a deeper clandestine technics, and also why discrete state transition even takes place, or: why time can only be linear and irreversible.",

This contribution presents an experimental approach that employs GenAI models as creative agents to explore evolving notions of urbanity.<br><br>In the experiment, multiple GenAI systems were tasked with designing a hypothetical modern city, producing visual renderings accompanied by textual narratives. These outputs are analyzed to uncover how AI interprets and reproduces urban forms and narratives. The approach reveals how AI can simultaneously reflect established urban patterns and generate novel, often unexpected configurations, effectively externalizing contemporary urban imaginaries through a technological lens.<br><br>The findings challenge urban theory by introducing insights from computational creativity and demonstrate how technology is reshaping cultural visions of city life.

        abstract: "The emergence of artificial intelligence and its integration into society represent a profound qualitative shift in the structure of the public sphere. This transformation is marked by unprecedented phenomena arising from feedback loops between human and artificial intelligence. We examine these developments through the lens of a long-standing tradition of public opinion and public sphere theory. Prigogine and Stengers’ critique of classical science—which privileges stability, order, uniformity, and equilibrium—can equally be applied here: public opinion is too often conceived as a fixed state, something to be represented in news media, measured in opinion polls, or captured by big-data analytics. In contrast, drawing on the philosophy of becoming (Deleuze, Bergson, Whitehead) and on Splichal’s recent theorization of gig-publics, we propose an alternative conceptualization of publicness. This perspective emphasizes radical change, transformation, and even rupture—conditions that resist deterministic measurement and instead unfold as complex, indeterminate, and often chaotic processes. The challenge, then, is to rethink how we understand and study publics in an age where human and artificial intelligences co-evolve and continually reshape the conditions of communication and collective life.",

        abstract: "My starting point will be a tension between two notions of the symbolic. In the ‘anglo’ intellectual context, symbolic means formal and logical language(s) and thought, meant to supplement or even replace the messy and unreliable natural language and everyday thinking; while in the Continental intellectual context, it mostly means the very basic feature(s) of natural language and everyday thinking, namely their propensity to abstraction as a release from lived experience(s) and concrete situation(s). In the context of AI theory and design, the first meaning of the symbolic relates to the automation of thinking as a linear, sequential procedure (symbolic AI), while the second meaning of the symbolic relates to the more recent problems, opened up by generative AI as modes of actual machine intelligence. My main thesis will be that, while important, automation is not what intelligence is but rather something that intelligence — whether living or machinic — does so rather than supplementing the symbolic as a mode of abstraction, the symbolic as a mode of automation itself has to be supplemented by a more generative and creative symbolic in order for any intelligence to function at all.",

The agent's surrounding world is primarily constituted by affordances, i.e., various possibilities of action, which include both “mental” acts and all others. I certainly argue that there is no privileged status of thought, or rather, I follow Wittgenstein, who writes in the <em>Blue book</em> that the place where thinking takes place is the point of contact between pen and paper—here I also refer to the concept of the operational chain and Leroi-Gourhan. The system of points of reference conditions every intentional content, which gives it a structural place similar to Aristotle's or Kant's system of categories, but with a different origin; points of reference are a matter of rules or habits and, as such, are culturally mediated. In this way, I can point out that the phenomena we usually call “technics” and cultural life are primarily distinguished by their social consequences, because every action is in itself a technology. In conclusion, I suggest that such a supplement to the techno-geographical milieu allows us to think of techniques not as opposed to humans, but as a scene of antagonism and alienation.",

From that point on, the gaze re-emerges as a product of socio-economic efforts that has been successfully converted into a stream of data, which is then mediated, parsed and reassembled within the framework of computational AI systems.<br><br>The fact that AI can relate to the external environment through complex statistical models is a fascinating technical achievement in itself. Similarly fascinating is the idea of placing algorithms at the heart of current aesthetic and political debates. So why should it be any different?<br><br>I believe a counter-position to this approach results from the study of technological principles. In my talk, I will argue that AI technologies have a surprisingly concrete, non-computational facet. The strength of visual techniques derives from their multiplicity and the various ways in which they can be linked to external entities. Recognising this variety is key to the study of AI vision, which takes up the mantle of debating how presupposed purely algorithmic systems resonate with their nearest surroundings.<br><br>I will emphasise the importance of carefully observing the environments that have emerged in relation to the development of contemporary vision technologies. In doing so, I link machine vision to collectives that work primarily with coarse-grained matter rather than computational tasks. I argue for research that, instead of insisting on technologies in terms of cloud-based computing, turns towards terrestrial phenomena reworked on the basis of photometry, visual communication design, and the geophysical study of ecosystems.
